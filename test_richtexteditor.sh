echo "4. Test the following formatting buttons:"
echo "   - B (Bold): Should wrap selected text or insert placeholder with <b> tags"
echo "   - I (Italic): Should wrap selected text or insert placeholder with <i> tags"  
echo "   - U (Underline): Should wrap selected text or insert placeholder with <u> tags"

echo "5. Verify that:"
echo "   - Text appears formatted (bold text looks bold, italic text looks italic, etc.)"
echo "   - HTML tags are NOT visible as plain text"
echo "   - Formatting buttons work both with selected text and at cursor position"

echo "6. Try keyboard shortcuts:"
echo "   - Ctrl+B for bold"
echo "   - Ctrl+I for italic"  
echo "   - Ctrl+U for underline"

echo "Expected Result: The formatting should be visually applied to the text in the editor."
echo "If you see HTML tags like <b>text</b> as plain text, the rich text rendering is not working."
