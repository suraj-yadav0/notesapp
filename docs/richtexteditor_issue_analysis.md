# RichTextEditor Issue Analysis & Solution

## Current Problem
The HTML tags (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, etc.) are being inserted as visible text in the TextEdit rather than being rendered as formatting.

## Root Cause
The issue occurs because:
1. **TextFormat Setting**: While `textFormat: TextEdit.RichText` is set, the HTML insertion method isn't working correctly
2. **Wrong Approach**: Manually inserting HTML tags doesn't automatically trigger rich text rendering
3. **QML Limitations**: TextEdit/TextArea in QML doesn't have the same rich text API as desktop applications

## Attempted Solutions

### ❌ **Approach 1: Manual HTML Insertion**
- Inserted HTML tags like `<b>text</b>` directly into text
- **Result**: Tags appeared as visible text instead of formatting

### ❌ **Approach 2: Font Property Manipulation**
- Tried to set `textEdit.font.bold = true`
- **Result**: TextArea/TextEdit font properties don't work this way in QML

### ❌ **Approach 3: Selection-based Formatting**
- Attempted to use `textEdit.select()` with font changes
- **Result**: These methods aren't available or don't work as expected

## Working Solution Options

### ✅ **Option 1: Simplified Rich Text with Manual HTML (Current)**
The current implementation should actually work if the HTML is properly formed. The issue might be:

```qml
// This should work:
textEdit.text = "<b>Bold text</b> and <i>italic text</i>"

// Make sure textFormat is set:
textFormat: TextEdit.RichText
```

### ✅ **Option 2: Use Qt Quick Controls 2 TextArea**
```qml
import QtQuick.Controls 2.15

TextArea {
    textFormat: TextArea.RichText
    // This supports better HTML rendering
}
```

### ✅ **Option 3: Custom Rich Text Component**
Create a hybrid approach with:
- Plain text editing mode
- Rich text preview mode
- Format conversion on save

## Current Implementation Status

The latest RichTextEditor implementation:
1. ✅ Uses proper `TextEdit` with `textFormat: TextEdit.RichText`
2. ✅ Inserts well-formed HTML tags
3. ✅ Has proper console logging for debugging
4. ✅ Handles both selection and cursor insertion
5. ✅ Provides clear formatting and bullet lists

## Testing the Current Solution

### To verify it works:
1. Build the app: `clickable build`
2. Create a new note and enable rich text mode
3. Type some text and select it
4. Click formatting buttons
5. Check console output for messages like "Setting bold formatting..."
6. Check if the text displays with formatting

### Expected behavior:
- HTML tags should be invisible
- Text should appear formatted (bold, italic, etc.)
- Lists should show as proper bullet points

### If still showing HTML tags:
The issue might be that the TextEdit component needs to be forced to re-render the rich text after insertion.

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Implementation**: Check if the latest build works
2. **Force Re-render**: Add `textEdit.update()` calls after formatting
3. **Alternative Component**: Try Qt Quick Controls 2 TextArea
4. **Hybrid Mode**: Implement preview mode for rich text display

The fundamental rich text functionality should work in QML - the key is getting the HTML rendering to trigger properly.
