# Navigation System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Replaced Complex AdaptivePageLayout with Simple PageStack**
**Problem**: The original navigation used `AdaptivePageLayout` which had complex page management APIs (`removePages`, `addPageToCurrentColumn`, `addPageToNextColumn`) that were causing errors and unreliable navigation.

**Solution**: Replaced with Lomiri's `PageStack` component which provides simple, reliable navigation with `push()` and `pop()` methods.

### 2. **Simplified Navigation State Management**
**Problem**: The app had complex state tracking variables (`settingsPageActive`, `todoPageActive`, etc.) and manual page lifecycle management.

**Solution**: Removed manual state tracking. The `PageStack` automatically manages page state and provides built-in navigation history.

### 3. **Fixed Page Component Structure**
**Problem**: Pages were instantiated as objects that stayed in memory, causing potential memory leaks and state conflicts.

**Solution**: Converted all pages to `Component` definitions that are instantiated only when needed and destroyed when popped from the stack.

### 4. **Added Proper Back Navigation**
**Problem**: Back navigation was inconsistent and some pages lacked back buttons.

**Solution**: 
- Added back button to `ToDoView` header
- Connected all page back signals to `pageStack.pop()`
- Simplified back navigation logic

### 5. **Fixed Keyboard Shortcuts**
**Problem**: Keyboard shortcuts were calling non-existent functions.

**Solution**: 
- Connected shortcuts to proper navigation functions
- Added `createNewNote()` function to `MainPage`
- Updated shortcuts to use centralized navigation functions

## New Navigation Architecture

### Core Structure
```qml
MainView {
    PageStack {
        id: pageStack
        // Simple push/pop navigation
    }
    
    // Page components (instantiated on demand)
    Component { id: mainPageComponent; MainPage { ... } }
    Component { id: noteEditPageComponent; NoteEditPage { ... } }
    Component { id: addNotePageComponent; AddNotePage { ... } }
    Component { id: todoPageComponent; ToDoView { ... } }
    Component { id: settingsPageComponent; SettingsPage { ... } }
}
```

### Navigation Functions
- `navigateToMainPage()` - Returns to main notes list
- `navigateToAddNote()` - Opens add note page
- `navigateToSettings()` - Opens settings page  
- `navigateToTodo()` - Opens todo page

### Back Navigation
All pages now properly handle back navigation:
- **Hardware back button**: Automatically handled by `PageStack`
- **Header back button**: Connected to `pageStack.pop()`
- **Radial menu**: Uses navigation functions to return to main page

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Simple `PageStack` navigation is more stable than complex adaptive layouts
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Pages are created/destroyed on demand instead of staying in memory
3. **Consistency**: All navigation uses the same pattern (push/pop)
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized navigation functions make it easier to modify behavior
5. **User Experience**: Consistent back navigation behavior across all pages

## Testing

The navigation system has been tested with:
- ✅ Clean build successful
- ✅ All page transitions working
- ✅ Back navigation functional
- ✅ Radial menu navigation working
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts operational

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Behavior**: Could add responsive behavior for different screen sizes while keeping the simple PageStack structure
2. **Page Caching**: Could implement intelligent page caching for frequently accessed pages
3. **Navigation Animation**: Could add custom transitions between pages
4. **Deep Linking**: Could add URL-based navigation for desktop environments
