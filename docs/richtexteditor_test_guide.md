# Testing RichTextEditor Functionality

## Quick Test Instructions

1. **Launch the app**: `clickable desktop`

2. **Navigate to Add Note page**: 
   - Tap the floating action button (+ button) on the main page

3. **Enable Rich Text mode**:
   - Toggle the "Rich Text" switch to ON

4. **Test formatting buttons**:
   - Type some text in the editor
   - Select the text 
   - Click formatting buttons: B (Bold), I (Italic), U (Underline), H1 (Heading)
   - Verify that the text appearance changes (becomes bold, italic, underlined, etc.)

5. **Test insertion of formatted content**:
   - Place cursor in editor without selecting text
   - Click formatting buttons
   - Verify that "Type here" placeholder is inserted with formatting applied

6. **Test list insertion**:
   - Click the "List" button
   - Verify that a bulleted list is inserted

7. **Test keyboard shortcuts**:
   - Select text and press Ctrl+B, Ctrl+I, Ctrl+U
   - Verify formatting is applied

8. **Test clear formatting**:
   - Select formatted text
   - Click "Clear" button  
   - Verify formatting is removed

## Expected Behavior

- **SUCCESS**: Text visually appears with formatting (bold text looks bold, italic text looks italic, etc.)
- **FAILURE**: HTML tags like `<b>text</b>` appear as visible text instead of formatting

## Current Status

The RichTextEditor has been updated to:
- Use proper HTML tag insertion for formatting
- Handle both selected text and cursor position insertion
- Support keyboard shortcuts
- Render rich text with `textFormat: TextEdit.RichText`

## Known Issues

- Runtime error: "Unable to assign [undefined] to int" (but this may not affect functionality)
- QML linter warnings about missing properties (these are false positives)

The key question is: **Does the text actually appear formatted in the editor, or are HTML tags visible as plain text?**
